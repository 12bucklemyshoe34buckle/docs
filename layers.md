# Layers

One sprite can be separated in several layers. You can see them
in the [timeline](timeline.md):

![Layer in timeline](layers/layer-in-timeline.png)

Each layer has several options:

![Layer icons](layers/layer-options.png)

*Layer Name*: Text to identify this layer.  You can change the layer
name double-clicking the layer, or from *Layer > Properties* menu (<kbd>Shift+P</kbd> key).

*Cels*: A set of [cels](cel.md), frames that contain something
visible for this specific layer in the specific frame.

*Visible*: It indicates if the layer is visible ![Visible layer icon](layers/visible-layer.png)
or hidden ![Hidden layer icon](layers/hidden-layer.png). You can switch the layer visibility
using *Layer > Visible* menu or <kbd>Shift+X</kbd> key.

*Locked*: If the layer is locked ![Locked layer icon](layers/locked-layer.png), you cannot draw on it.
By default all layers are unlocked/editable ![Editable layer icon](layers/editable-layer.png).

*Continuous*: This option is used to indicate what kind
of [cels](cel.md) you prefer when they are created for this
specific layer. See the [Continuous Layers](continuous-layers.md)
section for more information.

### Common Operations

* [Add new layer](new-layer.md)
* [Move layers](move-layers.md)
* [Copy layers](copy-layers.md)

## Background Layer

The background layer is an opaque layer (without alpha/transparent
component) that cannot be moved. It's created by default when you
select an opaque color in the *File > New* window, or when you open a
file (e.g. a `.png` file) that doesn't contain the alpha component.

A sprite can contain only one background layer and it's always at the
bottom of the layers stack in the [timeline](timeline.md).

When you select a portion of the background layer and clear it (using
*Edit > Clear* menu), the selection will be cleared with the active
[background color](color-bar.md).

## Transparent Layers

All layers with an alpha channel are called transparent layers.
You can have several of these kind of layers in the same sprite.
You can stack them as you want using the [timeline](timeline.md).
And you can displace these layers using the [Move tool](move-tool.md) ![Move tool icon](tools/move-tool.png)).

When you select a portion of a transparent layer and clear it (using
*Edit > Clear* menu), the selection will be cleared with
[transparent color](transparent-color.md).

## Background from Layer

If there is no background layer, you can convert the any transparent
layer to the background using the *Layers > Background from Layer*
menu. All transparent pixels will be filled with the active
[background color](color-bar.md#background-color).

## Layer from Background

If you want to convert the background to a transparent layer
(e.g. because you want to move it with the [Move tool](move-tool.md)
![Move tool icon](tools/move-tool.png)), you can use the *Layers >
Layer from Background* menu.
