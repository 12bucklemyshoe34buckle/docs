# Preview Window

The preview window is the little window that can show you the
animation preview in realtime while you edit your animation:

<img src="/docs/preview-window/preview-window.png" alt="Preview Window" class="x2" />

You can show/hide this little window pressing the `F7` key or with the
*View > Preview* menu option.

You can also press the little play button ![Play
button](preview-window/play-button.png) or press `Shift+Enter` to
start playing the sprite animation (or the current [tag](tags.md)) in
the window.
