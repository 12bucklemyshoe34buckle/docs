# Preview Window

The preview window is the little window that can show you the
animation preview in realtime while you edit your animation:

<img src="/docs/preview-window/preview-window.png" alt="Preview Window" class="xN" />

You can show/hide this window pressing the `F7` key or with the *View > Preview* menu option.
