# Troubleshooting

If you have a problem starting Aseprite (e.g. it starts and closes
inmediately), you can try:

1. [Reset your preferences](reset-preferences.md)
1. Use the [debug option](debug.md), this generates a `Aseprite-v1.2-DebugOutput.txt` file
1. Windows only: Check if the last line of the generated
   `Aseprite-v1.2-DebugOutput.txt` file says:
   `PEN: Wintab library loaded`. If that is the case, try [disabling Wintab](wintab.md).
1. In other case, contact us at
   [support@aseprite.org](mailto:support@aseprite.org) with the
   `Aseprite-v1.2-DebugOutput.txt` file.

You might also try to find your problem on:

* [Aseprite Community](https://community.aseprite.org)
